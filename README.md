# Lyre's Dictionary

Lyre's Dictionary is a computer program that generates dictionary entries for novel but etymologically plausible English words, based on actual roots and patterns in English.

It is also a group of bot accounts on [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/lyresdictionary), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@lyresdictionary), and [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/lyresdictionary.com) that post dictionary entries generated by the program.

You can find more information at [www.lyresdictionary.com](http://www.lyresdictionary.com).

## Usage

To run Lyre's Dictionary in the console, run lyre.py with the flag '--test'. It will generate an entry for one word and print it to the console.

To generate more entries at once, use the flag '-c' followed by an integer number.

To generate an entry for a word made from specific elements, use the flag '-k' followed by a comma-separated list of keys. The keys used are those in the "key" field of the entries in the morphs JSON files (located in the _data_ directory).

For example, the following command:
```
python3 lyre.py --test -k cornus,ate-bodypart
```

gives the following output:
> cornuate (adj)<br>
> having horns

## Requirements

Due to dependencies, Lyre's Dictionary requires Python 3.6 or higher to run.
